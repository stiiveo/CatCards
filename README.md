### Note
**Even though the lastest version of the code had been through many physical devices and simulator tests, only a few parts of the code had passed the unit testing since the testing code is still not completed yet (around 20% coverage), hence bugs and errors should be expected.**

### Footnote  
This is my first front–to–end iOS app project which is built with all the knowledge I've learned through the courses and resources on the internet.
Although it's not ready to be published onto the App Store yet, I've grown and learned so much in the process of developing this project.
